# Project Overview
Projects of this nature consist of the web coding of free figma designs on the [UI DESIGN DAILY](https://www.uidesigndaily.com/) website. In this structure, which I coded using the html scss language, I paid attention to class naming and systematic file structure.

There are two branches in the project. first-version is the complex version I wrote when I started coding. second-version covers the final version of the project. This is a part I did to compare my codes later and see how much I improved.
